## Introduction

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring Ansible on a Windows system using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Ansible allows you to manage remote machines, automate tasks, and deploy applications across multiple servers, making infrastructure management simpler and more efficient.

---

## Problem Statement

Setting up Ansible on a Windows system can be challenging due to its native Linux-based environment. This document explains how to install and configure Ansible on Windows using WSL, allowing Windows users to utilize Ansibleâ€™s automation capabilities seamlessly.

---

## Prerequisites

### Software Required
- **Windows 10 or later**
- **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**
- **Python 3.8 or later**
- **Ansible 2.9 or later**

### Hardware Requirement
- **4 GB RAM** or higher
- **20 GB** of free disk space
- **Internet access** for downloading packages

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step-1: Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

To run Ansible on a Windows machine, you need to install WSL to provide a Linux environment. Follow the steps below to enable and set up WSL.

1. **Enable WSL**

   ```bash
   wsl --install
   ```

   Once WSL is installed, restart your Windows system.

2. **Install Linux Distribution**

   Install Ubuntu as your Linux distribution:

   ```bash
   wsl --install -d Ubuntu
   ```

   > **Note**: During the setup, you will be asked to create a username and password for your WSL environment.

3. **Update Linux Packages**

   After setting up Ubuntu, update and upgrade the packages:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

### Step-2: Install Python and PIP
Ansible requires Python to function, so you need to install both Python and PIP on your WSL environment.

1. Install Python:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3
   ```

2. Install PIP:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-pip
   ```

3. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   pip3 --version
   ```

---

### Step-3: Install Ansible

After setting up Python, you can install Ansible using the following commands.

1. Add the Ansible repository:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
   ```

2. Install Ansible:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ansible
   ```

   ![images](../Ansible/images/ansible-9.png)

3. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   ansible --version
   ```

### Step-4: Create a Windows User and Configure WinRM

Before proceeding with Ansible configuration, ensure WinRM is configured on your Windows system for remote management.

1. **Create a new user in Windows**:

   - Username: `ansible_user`
   - Password: `P@ssw0rd`
   - Ensure the account type is set to **Administrator**.

2. **Open PowerShell with Administrator access** and check if WinRM is running. If it is not running, start the service with the following commands:

   ```bash
   winrm quickconfig
   ```

3. **Set WinRM configuration**:

   Configure WinRM to allow basic authentication:

   ```bash
   winrm set winrm/config/service/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
   ```

---

### Step-5: Configure Ansible

1. **Edit the Ansible Inventory**:

   In your WSL environment, open the Ansible inventory file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts
   ```

2. **Add Windows host configuration**:

   Add the following configuration to the file, replacing `<ip-address>` with the IP of the Windows machine you want to manage:

   ```ini
   [windows]
   <ip-address>

   [windows:vars]
   ansible_user=ansible_user
   ansible_password=P@ssw0rd
   ansible_connection=winrm
   ansible_winrm_transport=basic
   ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore
   ansible_port=5985
   ```

---

### Step-6: Test Ansible Installation

1. **Ping remote Windows hosts**:

   Test Ansible to ensure that it can communicate with the Windows host by running:
   ```bash
   ansible windows -m win_ping
   ```

   If successful, you will see a response confirming that the connection is established.
